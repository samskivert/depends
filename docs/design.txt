Dependency system design
------------------------

- Two interfaces: Java object interface and ANT wrapper

- If possible, use no external libraries to avoid bootstrapping problems
  (can't use depends to download depends for depends):
  + make use of built-in Java XML parsing services
  + make use of built-in Java logging services
  + will have to "depend" on ant

- Object interface available via the following classes:

  public class Dependency
  {
      public String getLibraryName ();

      public File getLocalJar ();

      public boolean isUpToDate ();

      public void bringUpToDate ();
  }

  public class DependencyParser
  {
      public <Dependency>List parseDependencies (
          File definition, File repository);
  }

  public class LibraryDescriptor
  {
  }
