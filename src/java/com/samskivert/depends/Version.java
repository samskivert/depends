/**
 * Represents a library version. Version strings are not constrained to a
 * particular format, but must meet a couple of criterion: first, they
 * must contain only valid filename characters as they will be used to
 * create the filename of our local copy of the library's jar file.
 * Second, if a dependency's version specification ends with a
 * '<code>+</code>', the dependency is considered satisfied by any library
 * release newer than the specified version. Thus, if a version string
 * ends in plus, wackiness ensues. Fortunately, we can issue a warning if
 * anyone tries to stamp a library with a descriptor that declares its
 * version to end with a plus.
